# Prototyping Sandbox

This repository contains my personal prototyping workspace where I experiment with hardware projects using different microcontrollers and single-board platforms. It is part of my ongoing learning process, and the projects here are meant for exploration, testing, and improving my skills.

## Platforms I work with
- Arduino Uno  
- Arduino Micro  
- Arduino Mega  
- Raspberry Pi  
- Raspberry Pi Pico  

## Components and hardware used
- Servos
- MOSFETs
- Resistors
- Sensors
- Buttons and switches
- Breadboards and wiring
- Power control elements

## What you will find here
- Small experimental builds
- Test sketches and example scripts
- Circuit setups and wiring notes
- Servo control tests
- GPIO interaction experiments
- Prototyping ideas and iterations

## Purpose of this repository
This repo exists to:
- document my progress
- learn through experimentation
- practice electronics and control logic
- build confidence with hardware interaction
- explore Arduino and Raspberry ecosystems

## Status
This is a learning-focused sandbox.  
Projects may be incomplete, messy, or replaced over time — that is intentional.

## Shared UI styling
For a consistent Tkinter look across projects, see `style-guide/` (template colors, layout pattern, and `tk_theme.py` helper).

## Contributions
Not expected, but always welcome if constructive.

## Disclaimer
These experiments involve electronics.  
Use caution, check wiring, and avoid damaging components or hardware.
